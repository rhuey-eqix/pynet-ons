Test 1a. Write a simple function that accepts a "dev" dictionary (dictionary 
with Netmiko connetion information) and a "cmd" string to execute on the device.
Return the output of the command from the function.

Using concurrent futures ThreadPoolExecutor, spawn threads to execute 
'show router arp' on four SR-OS routers.

Wait until all threads are completed, then iterate through the results and print
the result-output.


Test 1b. Repeat the test constructed in Test 1a except use pytest.mark.parametrize
to test sros1, sros2, sros3, and sros4. You should parametrize the device
dictionary and an IP address that shows up in the output.
