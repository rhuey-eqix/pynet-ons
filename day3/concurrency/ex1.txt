Write a simple function that accepts a "dev" dictionary (dictionary 
with Netmiko connetion information) and a "cmd" string to execute on the device.
Return the output of the command from the function.

Using concurrent futures ThreadPoolExecutor, spawn threads to execute 
'show router arp' on four SR-OS routers.

Wait until all threads are completed, then iterate through the results and print
the result-output.
