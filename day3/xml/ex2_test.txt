1. Write a test for XML exercise2 (Juniper RPC Exercise)

2. Your test should treat exercise2 as a black-box and execute it using the
   "subprocess_runner" function.

==========
std_out, std_err, return_code = subprocess_runner(cmd_list, exercise_dir=base_path)
==========

3. Your test should verify the following items:

    a. std_err is a null-string.
    b. The return_code is 0.
    c. std_out contains the string "inet6" twice and the string "inet" eight times.
       Note, the two "inet6" strings are included in the count of eight "inet"
       strings. In other words, there are 6 x IPv4 interfaces and 2 x IPv6 interfaces.
